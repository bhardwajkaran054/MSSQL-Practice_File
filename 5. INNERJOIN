Question 1:
Using the Person.Person and Person.Password tables, INNER JOIN the two tables using the BusinessEntityID column and return the FirstName and LastName columns from Person.Person and then PasswordHash column from Person.Password

SELECT
P.FirstName, P.LastName, PP.PasswordHash
FROM Person.Person P
INNER JOIN Person.Password PP
ON  PP.BusinessEntityID  =  P.BusinessEntityID

Question 2:
Join the HumanResources.Employee and the HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory tables together via an INNER JOIN using the BusinessEntityID column. Return the BusinessEntityID, NationalIDNumber and JobTitle columns from HumanResources.Employee and the DepartmentID, StartDate, and EndDate columns from HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory.

SELECT
E.BusinessEntityID, E.NationalIDNumber, E.JobTitle, EDH.DepartmentID, EDH.StartDate, EDH.EndDate
FROM  HumanResources.Employee  E
INNER  JOIN  HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory  EDH ON  E.BusinessEntityID  =  EDH.BusinessEntityID

Question 3:
Expand upon the query used in question 1. Using the existing query, add another INNER JOIN to the Person.EmailAddress table and include the EmailAddress column in your select statement.

SELECT
P.FirstName, P.LastName, PP.PasswordHash, E.EmailAddress
FROM Person.Person P
INNER JOIN Person.[Password] PP
ON  PP.BusinessEntityID  =  P.BusinessEntityID INNER JOIN Person.EmailAddress E
ON  E.BusinessEntityID  =  P.BusinessEntityID

***Question 4:
Using the Book, BookAuthor and Author tables, join them together so that you return the Title and ISBN columns from Book and the AuthorName column from Author. (Hint: You must start with the BookAuthor table in your FROM clause even though we will not be returning any columns from this table)

SELECT
B.Title, B.ISBN,
A.AuthorName

FROM BookAuthor BA INNER JOIN Book B
ON  B.BookID  =  BA.BookID INNER JOIN Author A
ON  A.AuthorID  =  BA.AuthorID

Question 5:
Using the query from example 4, add another INNER JOIN that joins the Publisher table with your query. Return the PublisherName column from this table. So, you should return the Title and ISBN columns from Book, the AuthorName column from Author, and the PublisherName column from Publisher. (Hint: this will require three separate INNER JOINs).

SELECT
B.Title, B.ISBN,
A.AuthorName, P.PublisherName
FROM BookAuthor BA INNER JOIN Book B
ON  B.BookID  =  BA.BookID INNER JOIN Author A
ON  A.AuthorID  =  BA.AuthorID INNER JOIN Publisher P
ON  P.PublisherID  =  B.PublisherID
